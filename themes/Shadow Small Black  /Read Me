Notes by original autor Android272:

The purpose of this theme was to completely change out every GIMP icon and make it beautiful.
This theme was made as a GIMP only theme but I'm sure that you can modify it to suit other 
GTK+ programs. My hope is that designers/enthusiasts might use my theme as a template for 
new themes to come. I am not a icon designer which I think is evident in my work. I tried 
to keep the same standards through out the theme but as you can see that did not always happen. 

Colored icons

If you do not like the colored icons for selected tools and when hovering over them then you can replace them. in the tools directory there are two folders, one for colored icons and the other for that themes icons. copy and replace these icons into the tools folder and everything should go back to the way it was when this theme was first released.

Installation

Copy themes into ~gimp-2.8/themes

Once this is done open GIMP and goto edit > preferences > themes > choose the theme you like best.

Modification

The "gtkrc" file is what controls the theme color scheme. I tried to comment it the best I could
so that you might know what every hex color did.  Just play around with everything until you know
what things do. The "imagerc" file is what changes out all the icons out. Like the ProGIMP theme
I made it so that when you hover over and select tools and even Dialog tabs the icons change.  My
theme just does not take advantage of this as it looked weird. All you should have to do is modify 
the icons while keeping the same names.  It is important that you do not change the names of any 
icons and even more importantly not to change the style name and stock id variables in the 
"imagerc" as this will mess the whole theme up. Note if you use a different file format for your 
icons you will have to change every file location in the "imagerc" file.  This is just a simple 
ctrl+H find all ".svg" and replace them with ".png" for example.  Also if you do not want your 
theme to change like the ProGIMP theme then either do like I did and make the normal icon and 
the colored icon the same with different names or delete the code where it changes the icons.
